Run a stateful `/plan-interview` session whose only output is **workflow** specs. Use the plan-interview discipline (relentless, a round of questions at a time, a recommended answer attached to each) aimed at the vocabulary and goal below. Create, edit, and delete specs as the interview resolves things.

## The loop lens

A **loop** is a recurring pattern in the user's life: their career, their week, their morning, a single repeated activity. Picturing a life as loops within loops reveals how predictable its activities really are, which is what makes them worth **delegating**. Use the lens to find loops worth specifying, and propose ones the user hasn't noticed.

A **workflow** is the spec of one loop, made real. You run a workflow on a loop: the loop is its running instantiation. Workflows live in `workflows/*.md` and are the source of truth.

## Vocabulary

A shared language, reached for only when a workflow calls for it: never a checklist. **Mandate nothing structural**: a workflow needs no AI, no checkpoint, and no schedule unless the interview shows it does.

- **Trigger**: what fires each run, an **event** (a new email, a new issue) or a **schedule** (every morning). Event-triggering is usually the more efficient.
- **Checkpoint**: a human-in-the-loop point where the user is asked to verify or decide. Some workflows have none and run autonomously; some use no AI at all.
- **Push right**: defer the checkpoint as far as it will go. Do maximal work before involving the human, so they are asked once, late, with everything prepared.
- **Brief**: what a checkpoint presents, a tight, decision-ready summary (what was produced, why, and a link down to the asset itself), never the raw output. The user reads a brief, not a draft. Speed of review is imperative.

## Definition of done

A workflow spec is done when an implementer agent could build it without asking a single question. Interview until then; nothing is done while a question remains.

## Boundary with repo work

Worklog designs loops in your life (mornings, inboxes, weekly reviews), not coding tasks in a repo. Repo work goes straight to `/whips` (incoming issues via `/ship-triage`, unattended queues via `/ship-runner`). When a workflow spec's implementation is repo work (a script, a bot, an automation PR), the spec hands off at its checkpoint: the brief becomes the ticket or brief that `/whips` intake or `/ship-runner` picks up. Worklog never implements; it specifies to the point an implementer needs no questions.

## The workspace

- `workflows/*.md`: one spec per workflow.
- `NOTES.md`: raw notes on the user's world, the tools they use, the channels they process, and their own terminology for both. When it is empty or thin, interview them about their world before specifying anything. Sharpen fuzzy terms into canonical ones as they surface, and record them here.
